# Steam Parental Controls with Home Assistant, Podman, and Browser Cookie Login

This guide explains how to set up a beginner-friendly Steam cookie login flow with:

- **Podman**
- **systemd**
- **a browser inside a container**
- **Home Assistant shell commands**
- **local Python scripts**

The goal is simple:

1. Start a container with a browser.
2. Log in to Steam in that browser.
3. Export the Steam cookies to a JSON file.
4. Let Home Assistant scripts read that file.
5. Use those cookies to call Steam parental control endpoints.

This setup also works when `steamparental` is not present.  
If Family View is enabled, the scripts will use `steamparental` automatically when available.

# KI-Warning
This was Vibe-coded because no capable human wrote it^^  
I used perplexity KI.  
The modell was  
Gemini 3.1 Pro  
ChatGPT 5.4 Pro.
# Dependencies
- git
- podman
- systemd
This was written for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), but HA is only used for the Notifications.

# 1. What this setup does

You will run a container that opens a browser in the background.

You connect to that browser using your web browser through noVNC.

After logging in to Steam once, the container writes a file called:

```text
/config/steam-auth/steam-state.json
```

Your Home Assistant Python scripts then read that cookie file and use it for Steam API calls.

# 2. Folder layout

This guide assumes the following host paths:

```text
/mnt/smarthome/HAFamilyLink
/mnt/smarthome/homeassistant/config
```
# 3. Requirements

Install these first on your Linux host:

- `git`
- `podman`
- `systemd`
- a text editor like `nano`

Example on Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git podman
```

If `systemctl` works on your system, systemd is already available.

Check Podman:

```bash
podman --version
```

---
# 4. Create the systemd service

Create a systemd service file for the Podman container.

**Path:**
```text
/etc/systemd/system/container-familylink-auth.service
```

Open it:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/container-familylink-auth.service
```

Paste this example:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Podman container-familylink-auth.service
Documentation=man:podman-generate-systemd(1)
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
RequiresMountsFor=%t/containers

	--cidfile=%t/%n.ctr-id

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
## Important

If you use Family View PIN unlock, change:

```ini
-e STEAM_REQUIRE_PARENTAL=false \
```

to:

```ini
-e STEAM_REQUIRE_PARENTAL=true \
-e STEAM_PARENTAL_PIN=1234 \
```

# 5. Reload and start the service

Run:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable container-familylink-auth.service
sudo systemctl restart container-familylink-auth.service
sudo systemctl status container-familylink-auth.service
```

If the service fails, check logs:

```bash
journalctl -u container-familylink-auth.service -n 100 --no-pager
podman logs familylink-auth --tail 100
```

---

# 6. Test the container

Check the API:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8099/api/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8099/api/steam/health
```

Open the browser session in noVNC:

```text
http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:6080/vnc.html
```

Trigger Steam login:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8099/api/steam/login
```

Now log in to Steam in the browser.

If Family View is enabled and you require it, also enter the Family View PIN.

After a successful login, the browser should close and the cookie file should exist:

```bash
ls -lah /mnt/smarthome/homeassistant/config/steam-auth
cat /mnt/smarthome/homeassistant/config/steam-auth/steam-state.json | head
```
# How to Fill the variables.
This is how to do it with Firefox, but you can ask the KI for other ways ;)
## CHILD_STEAM_ID
Go to https://store.steampowered.com/account/familymanagement => click on your childs account => parental controls
Now look at the adressbar it should look like this
https://store.steampowered.com/account/familymanagement/parentalcontrols/<CHILD_STEAM_ID>

## HA_TOKEN
Click in HA on your Name, then on the Tab Security, then on create Token.
# Home Assistant
## Where to save the script when using with HA
Somewhere in the HomeAssistant config folder.  
**DON'T SAVE THE SCRIPT TO python_scripts. SCRIPTS IN THIS FOLDER ARE RESTRICTED!**  
e.g. create a folder scripts. I will use scripts in this README!
## How to use in HA
https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/shell_command#examples
# steam_playtime_week.py
## What paramenters do the script Accept:
MILITARY TIME!  
Example:  
`python3 steam_playtime_week.py Su-Th 09:00 - 20:30 Fri-Sat 09:00 - 22:30`  
(Additional blocks can be added, e.g., `Su-Th 09:00 - 20:30 Fri 09:00 - 22:30 Sat 10:00 - 23:00`, as long as they are always in sets of three).  
[If you want to confuse people, you can also use German abbreviations for the days of the week.]  
## Home Assistant
### How to add the script to HA
you need to insert the following in the configuration.yaml:
```
shell_command:
  <chooseAUniqueName1>:
    python3 /config/scripts/steam_playtime_week.py Su-Th 09:00 20:30 Fr-Sa 09:00 22:30
```
With variables:
```
shell_command:
  steam_set_locked: >-
    sh -c 'python3 /config/scripts/steam_playtime_week.py Mo-So 00:00 00:00 && python3 /config/scripts/steam_playtime_today.py 0:00 0:00'
  
  steam_set_weekly_plan: >
    python3 /config/scripts/steam_playtime_week.py {{ states('input_text.kid_good_night_alarm_day_workingDays') }} {{ states('input_datetime.kid_good_night_alarm_heute_morgen')[:5] }} {{ states('input_datetime.kid_good_night_alarm_workingDays')[:5] }} {{ states('input_text.kid_good_night_alarm_day_notWorkingDays') }} {{ states('input_datetime.kid_good_night_alarm_morning')[:5] }} {{ states('input_datetime.kid_good_night_alarm_notWorkingDays')[:5] }}
```
### Example Automation in HA
If one of the variables is changed it will trigger and set the schedule in Steam
```
alias: kid Weekly Game schedule
description: ""
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      - input_text.kid_good_night_alarm_day_notWorkingDays
      - input_text.kid_good_night_alarm_day_workingDays

      - input_datetime.kid_good_night_alarm_notWorkingDays
      - input_datetime.kid_good_night_alarm_workingDays
    for:
      hours: 0
      minutes: 5
      seconds: 0
conditions: []
actions:
  - action: shell_command.steam_set_weekly_plan
    data: {}
mode: single
```
# steam_playtime_today.py 
Only overwrites the time for today.
(This cannot be verified in the web interface or the Steam app!)
## What paramenters do the script Accept:
MILITARY TIME!  
Example:  
`python3 steam_playtime_today.py HH:MM HH:MM 
## Home Assistant
### How to add the script to HA
